# Moon-Landing
This is a 3D stimulation game created and develop from scratch using C++ and Openframework framework

It is an individual assignment to help student understand

    * Building physics in a 3D environment, includinding Gravity, Turbulance Force and Impulse Force
    * Building Octree from scratch for terrain and detecting input rays
    * Using rays for collision detection
    * Building 3D models using Autodesk Maya and animation using Unity
    * Implementing 3D lighting system to lit up the scene
    * Setting cameras for the scene as well as tracking the object
    * Practicing article collisions between two 3D object
    
The whole game was built from scratch using C++ and Openframework

Models are built using Autodesk Maya and Unity

# Controls

**Arror Key** to move the spaceship around in the scene

**Space Bar** to use the thruster for straight up lifting power

**F1** to use the free camera that can move around the scene. Using 'c' to unlock control

**F2** to use spaceship tracking camera

**f3** to use downward camera which is attached to the spaceship's thruster

**F4** to use the cinematic camera

**F5** to use the attached camera that is being attached to the top of the spaceship watching the spaceship entrance
